I am working with .net and c#. I need a method for paginacion fo an IEnumerable<Country>.
Create a function that accepts numbers as an attribute and can limit the number of records.  
The functionality should accept a number and retrieve first n records (e.g., providing number `15` I should receive 15 first records from API).

Sure! You can create a method that accepts an IEnumerable<Country> and an integer n to return the first n records. You can use the LINQ Take method to achieve this.

Here's a simple example of how you might accomplish this:

csharp
Copy code
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Linq;

public class Country
{
    public string Name { get; set; }
    // Other properties
}

public static class CountryPagination
{
    public static IEnumerable<Country> GetFirstNRecords(IEnumerable<Country> countries, int n)
    {
        return countries.Take(n);
    }
}
You can then use this method by passing in your IEnumerable<Country> and the number of records you want to retrieve:

csharp
Copy code
IEnumerable<Country> allCountries = GetAllCountriesFromApi(); // Your method to get all countries
IEnumerable<Country> first15Countries = CountryPagination.GetFirstNRecords(allCountries, 15);
This will give you the first 15 records from the allCountries collection. Make sure to include the System.Linq namespace to enable the use of the Take method.
