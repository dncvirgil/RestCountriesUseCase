I am working with .net and c#. I need a method to filter an IEnumerable<Country> based on country population. The model for country is:
public class Country
{
    public int Population { get; set; }
}

The filter must use Population property. 
The filter should search for countries where the population is less than provided number from attributes in the millions of people (e.g., by providing value `10`, I should find countries with a population less than 10m)

Sure! You can filter an IEnumerable<Country> based on the population by using a LINQ query. You'll want to multiply the provided value by one million since the requirement is to filter in terms of millions of people.

Here's a method that takes an IEnumerable<Country> and an integer, and returns an IEnumerable<Country> with the countries that have a population less than the provided number in millions:

csharp
Copy code
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Linq;

public class Country
{
    public int Population { get; set; }
}

public class CountryFilter
{
    public static IEnumerable<Country> FilterByPopulation(IEnumerable<Country> countries, int millions)
    {
        return countries.Where(c => c.Population < millions * 1000000);
    }
}
You can then use this method like this:

csharp
Copy code
IEnumerable<Country> countries = GetCountries(); // Assume this method returns your list of countries
int filterValue = 10; // e.g., 10 million
IEnumerable<Country> filteredCountries = CountryFilter.FilterByPopulation(countries, filterValue);

foreach (var country in filteredCountries)
{
    Console.WriteLine($"Country with population: {country.Population}");
}
This will return only the countries with a population of less than 10 million.
