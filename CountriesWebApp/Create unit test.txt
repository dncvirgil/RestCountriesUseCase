I am working with .net and c#.
I have a service method that accepts 4 parameters: string country, int? population, string countrySort, int? numberOfRecords.
The method performs filtering, sorting and pagination based on this 4 parameters for a list of Countries. The list of countries is obtain from an api client by calling 
var countries = await _apiClient.GetAllCountriesAsync();
Service class name is CountriesService and method name is GetCountriesAsync which returns Task<IEnumerable<Country>>
Create Unit tests for all 4 functions (filter, filter, sort, pagination) created using xunit and moq

Certainly! Writing unit tests helps ensure that individual components of your codebase are working as expected. Here's how you might write tests for the GetCountriesAsync method of the CountriesService class, covering the four functionalities: filtering by country, filtering by population, sorting, and pagination. We'll be using xUnit and Moq to achieve this.

Filtering by Country
Filtering by Population
Sorting
Pagination
Before diving into each of the specific test cases, you should make sure to set up the testing project appropriately.

Project Setup
Add a reference to xUnit and Moq NuGet packages.
Create a test class CountriesServiceTests to contain all the test methods.
Sample Tests
Here's how you might write the tests.

csharp
Copy code
using Moq;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Linq;
using System.Threading.Tasks;
using Xunit;

namespace YourNamespace.Tests
{
    public class CountriesServiceTests
    {
        private readonly Mock<IApiClient> _apiClientMock;
        private readonly CountriesService _countriesService;

        public CountriesServiceTests()
        {
            _apiClientMock = new Mock<IApiClient>();
            _countriesService = new CountriesService(_apiClientMock.Object);
        }

        [Fact]
        public async Task GetCountriesAsync_FiltersByCountry()
        {
            var countries = new List<Country>
            {
                new Country { Name = "USA" },
                new Country { Name = "India" },
                new Country { Name = "UK" },
            };
            _apiClientMock.Setup(x => x.GetAllCountriesAsync()).ReturnsAsync(countries);

            var result = await _countriesService.GetCountriesAsync("India", null, null, null);

            Assert.Single(result);
            Assert.Equal("India", result.First().Name);
        }

        [Fact]
        public async Task GetCountriesAsync_FiltersByPopulation()
        {
            var countries = new List<Country>
            {
                new Country { Name = "USA", Population = 331000000 },
                new Country { Name = "India", Population = 1380000000 },
                new Country { Name = "UK", Population = 67000000 },
            };
            _apiClientMock.Setup(x => x.GetAllCountriesAsync()).ReturnsAsync(countries);

            var result = await _countriesService.GetCountriesAsync(null, 100000000, null, null);

            Assert.Equal(2, result.Count());
        }

        [Fact]
        public async Task GetCountriesAsync_SortsByCountryName()
        {
            var countries = new List<Country>
            {
                new Country { Name = "India" },
                new Country { Name = "USA" },
                new Country { Name = "UK" },
            };
            _apiClientMock.Setup(x => x.GetAllCountriesAsync()).ReturnsAsync(countries);

            var result = await _countriesService.GetCountriesAsync(null, null, "Name", null);

            Assert.Equal(countries.OrderBy(c => c.Name), result);
        }

        [Fact]
        public async Task GetCountriesAsync_PaginatesResults()
        {
            var countries = Enumerable.Range(1, 100).Select(i => new Country { Name = $"Country{i}" }).ToList();
            _apiClientMock.Setup(x => x.GetAllCountriesAsync()).ReturnsAsync(countries);

            var result = await _countriesService.GetCountriesAsync(null, null, null, 10);

            Assert.Equal(10, result.Count());
        }
    }
}
In the above code:

The GetCountriesAsync_FiltersByCountry method tests that the correct country is filtered.
The GetCountriesAsync_FiltersByPopulation method tests that countries with a population greater than a certain number are filtered.
The GetCountriesAsync_SortsByCountryName method tests that countries are sorted by their name.
The GetCountriesAsync_PaginatesResults method tests that the correct number of countries is returned when pagination is applied.
Note: You'll need to adjust the above tests to match the actual implementation of your CountriesService.GetCountriesAsync method, as the exact behavior may depend on the specific logic and data structures in your code. Make sure that the method's functionality aligns with the tests you're writing, and don't hesitate to write more specific test cases to cover edge scenarios or additional requirements.
